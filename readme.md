# Finite State Machine

Modulo Three Exercise

This code is an implementation of a finite state machine automata specifically to solve the 'mod-three' problem.

The 'mod-three' problem is deriving the remainder when dividing a whole number by three.

To find the results of a number, you can use a browser to navigate to the /index.php file. The class file ModThree/FSM.php will accept a properly formed input and transition between states and various input until it finds a result.

A unit test file /unit_tester.php is used to execute a battery of tests which will verify expected outputs to various input situations. The class file ModThree/SimpleTester.php will run through all available states and inputs.

See Modulo Three - FSM Exercise.pdf for details.
